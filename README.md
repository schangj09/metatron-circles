# Description
Metatron’s Cube is a form of sacred geometry related to the Flower of Life.

The idea of this program came from an interview I watched of Robert Edward Grant. During the interview he talked about his view of the meaning of Metatron’s Cube. Within the lines of the Metatron’s Cube one can find many regular polygons. In addition, he states, if you superimpose 4 views, which are rotated by 45 degrees each, then the resulting lines contains the projections of an extraordinary number of 3 dimensional regular solids. He states that finding the forms within the lines can be a rewarding process.

<blockquote>Note: at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ykU-JxyGWQ&t=1596s target="_metatronvideo"">26:36</a> he has completed the drawing of a subset of the lines of 4 rotated views of Metatron’s cube, which you can compare to the output of the program.</blockquote>

I was very curious what this form of Metatron’s Cube looks like and I wanted to try viewing myself, so I wrote this program to draw the Metatron’s Cube on the screen with the rotations. Also, I added the print functionality to make a hard copy on the laser printer.

Feel free to try it out and if you have ideas to make it better, let me know.


## The main features include
- *Drawing Metatron's Cube:* The program's primary function is to draw Metatron's Cube on the screen. Metatron's Cube is a form of sacred geometry composed of lines and shapes that are interconnected in a specific pattern. 
- *Rotated Views:* In addition to drawing the basic Metatron's Cube, the program has the capability to overlay 2 or 4 rotated versions to provide expanded perspectives of the same geometric structure. 
- *Printing Functionality:* The program also allows users to print the displayed Metatron's Cube and its rotated views. 

## Build and run
### Option 1
Run the shell script: <code>./run.sh</code>
### Option 2
Open the project with NetBeans and run or debug from there.

## A few ideas for improvements
- fix the coloring issue in the drop-down when deselected color
- add a slider for line width
- more options for limiting the number of lines
- shading
